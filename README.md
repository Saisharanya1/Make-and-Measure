# Make and Measure 👗✨  

**Make and Measure** is an AI-powered web application that helps users estimate stitching costs and visualize their dresses before tailoring. The platform takes **body measurements**, **dress type**, and **fabric choice** as input and outputs both the **stitching cost** and a **generated dress image** for better decision-making.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 📏 **Body Measurement Input** – Users can provide key measurements manually.  
- 👗 **Dress Type Selection** – Choose from popular dress types:  
  - Tunics  
  - Punjabi Suits  
  - Frocks  
  - Short Kurti  
  - Skirt  
  - Saree  
- 🧵 **Fabric Choice** – Select fabric type for accurate pricing (Cotton, Linen, Polyester, Organza, Velvet, Silk).  
- 💰 **Stitching Cost Estimation** – AI model calculates stitching cost based on dress type, fabric, and measurements.  
- 🎨 **AI Dress Visualization** – Integration with OpenAI’s image generation API to generate a preview of the selected dress.  
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Built with Django, HTML, and CSS for a smooth experience.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **AI/ML:** RandomForestRegressor for cost estimation and fal-ai/sana/sprint model through API for image generation
